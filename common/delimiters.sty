% I use mathtools' paired delimiters functionality since this is as canonical as it gets within LaTeX.
% The name of the macro often differs from its usage, as is customary in TeX. For example, I don't actually use Bra-Ket notation.
% The motivation for naming the macro \braket comes from analogous macros in other packages like "physics" and "braket".

% \given acts like a resizable vertical pipe with some horizontal spacing around it.
% \given by itself inserts a simple vertical pipe with no resizing.
% In analogy to mathtools' delimiter syntax, \given* is autosized and \given[\Big] is manually sized.
% Use \given* with caution, especially in fractions. Unexpected things happen sometimes.
% Note: \delimsize is only defined within the body of a paired delimiter macro so we have to check if it is defined at all.
